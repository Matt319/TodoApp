How to use

This project is split into two sections. /frontend contains all the React code and /backend contains all the Go code. Both the frontend and backend must be started seperately. I have included bash scripts to run which will install all the dependancies as well as start the service.

I also purposly uploaded the .env file for the backend and frontend since this is not a production application and it will make your setup much easier.
